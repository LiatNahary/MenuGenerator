**Weekly Menu Generator**

Are you tired of deciding what to cook each week?
Looking for a menu that balances variety with familiarity? The Weekly Menu Generator is here to help!

Key Features:
**Built in Java:** A complete Java application.
**Advanced Random Generation:** Utilizes a top-of-the-line random generator algorithm that I wrote.
**Categorized Recipe Retrieval:** Accesses a structured recipe file system for easy navigation.

This project marks my first foray into Java and ignited my passion for programming.
I cherish it for its sentimental value and am incredibly proud of what I've accomplished.
Starting from scratch, I learned Java, Spring, Postman, and Gradle, alongside OOP concepts and REST APIs.


TL;DR what's in this project: my determination to learn!
